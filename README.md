## About 

JIGS NODEJS is a template framework for NodeJS. JIGS NODEJS attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of NodeJS/web projects, such as:

- [x] Clean architecture
- [x] Singleton design pattern
- [ ] Custom midleware
  - [ ] Forward router
  - [ ] Build message through midleware
- [x] Simple setup routing engine.
- [ ] Support many type database
  - [ ] MongoDB
  - [x] PostgreSQL
- [x] Server Side Rendering
  - [x] I18n
  - [x] Handlebars
- [x] Robust background job processing with Node-cron
- [x] Easily unit testing (Jest)
- [ ] Webpack and babel
- [x] Script for hide enviroment (.env, docker-compose, ...)
- [x] Docker setup for build image and enviroment.

The idea is build a context contain all services we need. We will require only in the first time instead call require any where.
